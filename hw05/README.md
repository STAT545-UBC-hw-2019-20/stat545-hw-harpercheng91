:exclamation: Upon reviewing my code, I detected a typo for excercise 2.1 :exclamation:
```
# Check the number of factors/levels for `continent` in the `africa_asia` subset.
```
The name of the dataset should be `no_oceania` as opposed to `africa_asia`. I could not change this because by the time this typo was catched, the due date for the assignment has already passed.   

I hope this comment I included in the README.md could clear this thing up.
