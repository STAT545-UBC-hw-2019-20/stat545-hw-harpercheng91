## About the author
My name is **Harper**. I am a first year master student in biostatistics. I studied biomedical toxicology and statistics back in undergrad, so my career path almost surely converges to the field of biostats. It is exciting just to think how much more we can accomplish in medical researches and clinical trials with the help of statistical anaylsis.

I am the world's most indoorsy person you can ever find. And that gives me tons of time to waste on Netflix, old movies and exploring old school rock music way ahead of my time. As a hardcore horror film fan, I see it has a portal for me to burn some extra calories while lazing in my comfy chair. 

Below, you can find one of my proudest doodles that I did for Paul McCartney while channeling my inner Beatlemania, just to show you how talentless I am. You may not know my face, but hopefully you can recognize this <del>piece of art</del> if you ever see me with my bkr water bottle.
